# Hadoop Ecosystem and Big Data Processing

## The Big Data Challenge

As data volumes continue to grow exponentially year over year, two primary challenges emerge:

1. How to process vast amounts of data efficiently
2. How to store and manage this data effectively

> [!note]
> The solutions to these challenges have given rise to a rich ecosystem of tools and technologies, with Apache Hadoop at its core.

## Distributed Storage: HDFS

### Overview

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) addresses the storage problem by partitioning data across multiple nodes.

Key features:
- Stores data in small partitions across various locations
- Can handle multiple datasets simultaneously
- Ensures data reliability through replication

### Fault Tolerance

To mitigate hardware failures:
- HDFS maintains multiple copies of each data partition
- These copies are distributed across different storage nodes

> [!info]
> This redundancy ensures that if one piece of hardware fails, the data remains accessible from other locations.

## Data Processing: MapReduce and Beyond

### MapReduce

Initially, Hadoop used MapReduce for data processing:
- A programming model that abstracts reading/writing from/to disks
- Can be viewed as a batch query processor
- Writes intermediate results to disk, which can be slow for iterative algorithms

### YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

YARN revolutionized the Hadoop ecosystem:
- Cluster resource management system
- Allows any distributed processing framework to run on a Hadoop cluster
- Enabled the development of new processing models beyond MapReduce

## Evolution of Processing Patterns

### Impala

- Parallel processing SQL query engine
- Enables low-latency SQL queries directly against large Hadoop datasets
- Distributed architecture with Impala Daemon running on each data node
- Ensures high availability and fault tolerance

### Apache Hive with Tez

Hive uses Apache Tez for query execution:

1. Container mode:
   - Requests a container from YARN for each Hive query

2. Execution optimization:
   - Creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for query execution
   - Avoids writing intermediate data to disk, improving performance
   - Enables object reuse across applications within the same container

```
Tez advantages:
● Eliminates intermediate disk I/O operations, saving time on large datasets
● Improves resource management through object reuse in containers
● Enhances overall query performance
```

### Apache Spark

- Unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing
- In-memory processing capabilities, significantly faster than MapReduce for many workloads
- Supports batch processing, interactive queries, streaming, and machine learning

## Key Components in the Hadoop Ecosystem

### HBase

- A key-value store built on top of HDFS
- Provides real-time read/write access to large datasets
- Suitable for scenarios requiring random, realtime read/write access to Big Data

### Apache Hadoop

A collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation.

Key components:
1. HDFS (storage)
2. YARN (resource management)
3. MapReduce (processing model, though often replaced by Spark in modern deployments)

## Conclusion

The Hadoop ecosystem has evolved significantly from its initial MapReduce-centric design. Modern big data architectures often combine multiple technologies:

- HDFS or cloud object storage for data storage
- YARN for resource management
- Spark, Hive, or Impala for data processing
- HBase or other NoSQL databases for real-time data access
