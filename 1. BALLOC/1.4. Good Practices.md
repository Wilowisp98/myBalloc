## CAST/FUNCTIONS WHILE JOINING

### Key Concept
Using functions (e.g., CAST) while joining tables is generally not recommended for performance reasons.

### Why It's Problematic
1. **Lack of Predictability**: The database engine cannot predict the result of functions applied to column values.
2. **Index Inefficiency**: This unpredictability prevents the engine from effectively using indexes.
3. **Search Argument (SARG) Issues**: The engine cannot use search arguments optimally.
4. **Row-by-Row Processing**: Forces the engine to evaluate each row individually, rather than using more efficient set-based operations.

### Performance Impact
- Significantly slower query execution times
- Increased CPU usage
- Potential for full table scans instead of index seeks

### Best Practices
1. Avoid using functions in JOIN conditions when possible
2. If necessary, consider:
   - Precalculating values and storing them
   - Creating computed columns with appropriate indexing
   - Rewriting queries to move functions to the WHERE clause

### Example of Problematic Query

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM 
	TableA a
JOIN 
	TableB b ON CAST(a.ID AS VARCHAR(10)) = b.StringID
```

### Example of what should be done instead

```sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM (
	SELECT
		a.*,
		CAST(a.ID AS VARCHAR(10)) as ID_CONNECT
	FROM 
		TableA a
) a
JOIN 
	TableB b 
ON a.ID_CONNECT = b.StringID
```

### DATATYPES

Common SQL data types and their characteristics:

1. INT
    - Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
    - Range: Up to 2^32 - 1 (approximately 2.14 billion)
    - Use case: Whole numbers within its range
2. BIGINT
    - Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
    - Range: Up to 2^64 - 1 (approximately 9.22 quintillion)
    - Use case: Very large whole numbers
3. DECIMAL(N,Y)
    - N: Total number of digits
    - Y: Number of decimal places
    - Use case: Precise fractional numbers (e.g., financial calculations)

Performance Considerations:

- Operations on DECIMAL types are computationally heavier than INT/BIGINT operations.
- INT types are faster and simpler, preferred when decimal precision isn't necessary.
- Choose DECIMAL when precise fractional representation is crucial, despite the performance trade-off.
