### Key Concepts

- **Lakehouse**: Architecture enabling efficient AI and BI on vast amounts of data stored in Data Lakes
- **Data Lake**: Central location holding large amounts of data in native, raw format using flat architecture and object storage

# Delta Lake

## Overview

Delta Lake is an open-source project that enables building a lakehouse on top of existing cloud storage.

### What Delta Lake is NOT:
- A storage format
- A database service or data warehouse

### What Delta Lake IS:
- Built upon standard data formats (mainly Parquet)
- Optimized for cloud object storage (though it runs on various mediums)
- Built for scalable metadata handling (quickly return point data)

## ACID Guarantees

Delta Lake guarantees ACID properties:

1. **Atomicity**: All transactions succeed or fail completely.
2. **Consistency**: Guarantees the state of the data between simultaneous operations.
3. **Isolation**: Manages how simultaneous operations conflict with one another.
4. **Durability**: Ensures that committed changes are permanent.

### ACID Solves:
- Difficulty in appending data
- Modification of existing data
- Job failures midway (changes are not committed until success)
- Real-time operations thanks to atomic micro-operations
- Historical data preservation through logs and snapshot queries, allowing time travel

> **Note**: Delta is the standard format in Databricks.

## Delta Transaction Log

- An ordered record of every transaction performed on a Delta Lake table since its inception.
- Stores a single source of truth, a repository with all changes users make to the table.
- When a user performs a SELECT on a table, the Spark engine checks the Delta log repo and updates the table to the last version.

### Handling Concurrent Reads and Writes

Delta Lake uses **optimistic concurrency control**:
- Assumes transactions from different users can often complete without conflict.
- Has a protocol for resolving conflicts when they occur.

1. Delta starts with version 0.
2. Users 1 and 2 attempt to append data, creating a conflict.
3. Mutual exclusion is applied, allowing only User 1 to write.
4. If version 001 and 002 don't differ, User 2 automatically applies 002.
5. If they differ, User 2's reading version is silently updated to 001, then commits changes.

```
Note: Errors can occur when conflicts can't be resolved optimistically, e.g., if both users delete the same file.

### Useful Commands

- `DESCRIBE HISTORY`: View Delta table history
- `COPY INTO`: Efficient for adding small files multiple times to a table
- `OPTIMIZE`: Compact small files
- `ZORDER`: Index by a specific column
- `VACUUM`: Clean files from older versions of a Delta table (use `RETAIN X HOURS`)
- `RESTORE TABLE`: Restore the table to a previous version
