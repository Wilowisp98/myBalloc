# My Obsidian Notes Repository

hey there! welcome to wilows balloc notes repository (a play on malloc, implying allocating mental resources), my personal collection of notes. this repository contains everything i find worth saving, from the simplest ideas to the most complex concepts. these notes are a reflection of my ongoing learning journey, and i hope you find them useful.

### Important Notice

while i've put a lot of effort into documenting accurate and valuable information, please keep in mind that not everything here is guaranteed to be 100% correct. i encourage you to approach these notes with an open mind and verify information as needed.

### Work in Progress

this repository is a work in progress. i will continually be adding, updating, correcting, and organizing the content as i learn more.
