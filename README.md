# My Obsidian Notes Repository

Hey yo! Welcome to Wilow's balloc notes repository (a play on malloc, implying allocating mental resources), my personal collection of notes! This repository contains everything I find worth saving, from the simplest ideas to the most complex concepts. These notes are a reflection of my ongoing learning journey, and I hope you find them useful.

### Important Notice

While I've put a lot of effort into documenting accurate and valuable information, please keep in mind that not everything here is guaranteed to be 100% correct. I encourage you to approach these notes with an open mind and verify information as needed.

### How to Use

These notes are designed to be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). To get the full experience, make sure to open and use the repository with Obsidian.

### Work in Progress

This repository is a work in progress. I will continually be adding, updating, correcting, and organizing the content as I learn more.
